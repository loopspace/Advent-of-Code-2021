# Advent of Code 2021

I thought I'd have a go at the [Advent of Code
2021](https://adventofcode.com/).
I've learnt a bit about programming in LaTeX3 this year, so decided to
practise a bit more by doing the AoC in LaTeX3.

I've decided to work with a `dtx` file so that I can contain the
documentation alongside the code.
To compile it, run:

~~~
pdflatex advent_code.dtx
